# 🔧 Final Fix Applied - eBay API Hash Calculation

## 🎯 **Root Cause Identified & Fixed**

The issue was that the `EbayCompliance.js` route was loading the configuration **once at startup** using a cached `EBAY_CONFIG` object. Even after restarting the server, the configuration was locked in at module load time.

## 🔄 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Dynamic Configuration Loading**
- **Before**: `const EBAY_CONFIG = { ... }` (loaded once at startup)
- **After**: `function getEbayConfig() { ... }` (loads fresh values on each request)

### 2. **Consistent Path Resolution**
- **Before**: Different path resolution between `server.js` and `EbayCompliance.js`
- **After**: Both use the same path resolution method

### 3. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Added console logs to show which endpoint URL is being used
- Added hash input logging for debugging

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Restart your server** (the changes require a restart)
2. **Run the test suite**:
   ```bash
   node comprehensive-ebay-test.js
   ```

## 📋 **Expected Results After Restart**

The test should now show:
```
✅ SSL Certificate: Certificate chain is valid and trusted
✅ Health Check: Health endpoint responding correctly
   Endpoint: https://www.phxautogroup.com/api/partsmatrix  (← Should show www now)
✅ Challenge Verification: Working properly (hash match)
✅ Error Handling: Correctly rejecting invalid requests
✅ POST Request: Processing notifications successfully
✅ Headers Compatibility: All eBay-compatible headers present
```

**Success Rate: 100% (6/6 tests passing)**

## 🔍 **Debugging Helpers**

If you want to verify the environment loading is working:
```bash
node test-env-loading.js
```

This will show you exactly what environment variables are being loaded.

## 📊 **Key Changes Summary**

1. **server.js** - Fixed .env path loading with logging
2. **EbayCompliance.js** - Changed from static config to dynamic config function
3. **All route handlers** - Now use `getEbayConfig()` for fresh values
4. **Health endpoint** - Now returns current configuration values
5. **Enhanced logging** - Shows which endpoint URL is being used in hash calculation

## 🎯 **Why This Fixes Both Issues**

1. **Hash Mismatch**: Now uses fresh environment variables on each request
2. **Cache-Control Header**: Middleware properly sets headers for all responses

The fundamental issue was configuration caching - the server was using old values even after restart because they were cached in the module scope.
