echo "=========================================="
echo ""
echo "Issue 1: Missing Intermediate Certificates"
echo "- eBay requires a complete certificate chain"
echo "- Your certificate must include all intermediate certificates"
echo "- Check with your certificate provider (Let's Encrypt, Cloudflare, etc.)"
echo ""
echo "Issue 2: Incorrect Certificate Order"
echo "- Order should be: Server Certificate -> Intermediate(s) -> Root"
echo "- Some servers require explicit chain configuration"
echo ""
echo "Issue 3: SSL/TLS Version Compatibility"
echo "- eBay may require specific TLS versions (1.2+)"
echo "- Older SSL versions might be rejected"
echo ""
echo "Issue 4: Certificate Authority Trust"
echo "- eBay's servers must trust your certificate authority"
echo "- Some CAs may not be in eBay's trust store"
echo ""
echo "üí° Next Steps if SSL Issues Found:"
echo "================================="
echo "1. Contact your hosting provider about SSL certificate chain"
echo "2. Ensure all intermediate certificates are properly installed"
echo "3. Test with: curl -I https://$DOMAIN$ENDPOINT_PATH/health"
echo "4. Verify certificate chain with SSL Labs test"
echo "5. Check server logs during eBay's validation attempts"
