# eBay API Connectivity Fix - Deployment Checklist

## 🔧 Issues Identified & Fixed

### Primary Issue: URL Redirect (HTTP 301)
- **Problem**: eBay test was hitting `https://phxautogroup.com/api/partsmatrix` but server redirects to `https://www.phxautogroup.com/api/partsmatrix`
- **Solution**: ✅ Updated all configurations to use `www.phxautogroup.com`

### Secondary Issues: CORS & Headers
- **Problem**: Missing proper CORS headers and content-type headers for eBay API compatibility
- **Solution**: ✅ Added eBay-specific middleware with proper headers

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration (.env)
```diff
- EBAY_ENDPOINT_URL=https://phxautogroup.com/api/partsmatrix
+ EBAY_ENDPOINT_URL=https://www.phxautogroup.com/api/partsmatrix
```

### 2. eBay Compliance Route (src/api/routes/EbayCompliance.js)
- ✅ Updated default endpoint URL to use www subdomain
- ✅ Added comprehensive middleware for CORS headers
- ✅ Added proper Content-Type headers for JSON responses
- ✅ Added OPTIONS request handling for preflight requests
- ✅ Enhanced health endpoint with proper caching headers
- ✅ Added detailed logging for debugging

### 3. Main API Router (src/api/index.js)
- ✅ Added OPTIONS handler for /partsmatrix endpoint
- ✅ Proper CORS headers for eBay-specific requests

### 4. Test Suite Updates
- ✅ Updated comprehensive-ebay-test.js to use www subdomain
- ✅ Updated SSL test URL to test www subdomain

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Quick Debug Test
```bash
node debug-www-redirect.js
```
This will verify that both URLs work and show any redirects.

### 2. Full Compliance Test
```bash
node comprehensive-ebay-test.js
```
This should now pass all tests.

### 3. Manual Tests
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl -v "https://www.phxautogroup.com/api/partsmatrix/health"

# Test challenge verification
curl -v "https://www.phxautogroup.com/api/partsmatrix?challenge_code=test123"

# Test CORS headers
curl -v -X OPTIONS "https://www.phxautogroup.com/api/partsmatrix" \
  -H "Origin: https://api.ebay.com" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type,X-EBAY-SIGNATURE"
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy Updated Code
```bash
# If using git deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Fix eBay API connectivity - update to www subdomain and add CORS headers"
git push origin main

# Or manually upload the changed files:
# - .env
# - src/api/routes/EbayCompliance.js  
# - src/api/index.js
# - comprehensive-ebay-test.js
```

### 2. Restart Server
```bash
# Restart your Node.js server
npm run start
# or
pm2 restart all
# or however you restart your production server
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Run the test suite after deployment
node comprehensive-ebay-test.js
```

### 4. Update eBay Developer Portal
1. Log into eBay Developer Portal
2. Navigate to your Marketplace Account Deletion notification settings
3. Update endpoint URL to: `https://www.phxautogroup.com/api/partsmatrix`
4. Use verification token: `FukPTXCa1Ip4gkhoJ33p6iIHM4FESCkzzDqHfuaxKlUrWRKmFMlqELtGwXHB4jhc`
5. Test the endpoint validation in eBay portal

## 🔍 Expected Results After Fix

The comprehensive test should now show:
- ✅ SSL Certificate: Valid and trusted
- ✅ Health Check: Responding correctly  
- ✅ Challenge Verification: Working properly
- ✅ Error Handling: Correctly rejecting invalid requests
- ✅ POST Request: Processing notifications successfully
- ✅ Headers Compatibility: All eBay-compatible headers present

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If tests still fail:

1. **Check DNS propagation**: Ensure www.phxautogroup.com resolves correctly
2. **Verify server restart**: Make sure the server restarted with new code
3. **Check logs**: Look at server logs for any errors during startup
4. **SSL certificate**: Run SSL test at https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=www.phxautogroup.com

### Common issues:
- **Still getting 301 redirects**: DNS cache issue, wait a few minutes or flush DNS
- **CORS errors**: Check that middleware is loaded before other routes
- **500 errors**: Check server logs for specific error messages

## 📞 Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. ✅ Run test suite to verify all tests pass
2. ✅ Update eBay Developer Portal with new endpoint URL
3. ✅ Test eBay's endpoint validation tool
4. ✅ Monitor logs for any incoming eBay notifications
5. ✅ Set up monitoring/alerting for the endpoint

---

**🎯 Summary**: The main issue was the URL redirect from non-www to www. All configuration has been updated to use `www.phxautogroup.com` and proper CORS/headers have been added for eBay API compatibility.
